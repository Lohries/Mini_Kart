# Mini_Kart

This is a mini-cart equipped with two motors responsible for controlling the direction of the cart. Additionally, it features three ultrasonic sensors designed to calculate the distance between the vehicle and surrounding objects. To enable precise control of the motors, the setup includes a current-control unit, which allows the motors to operate in both directions. The brain of this autonomous robot is an Arduino UNO, hosting the program that enables the robot to navigate autonomously by avoiding obstacles in its path.
